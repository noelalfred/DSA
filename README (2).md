Q5	Write a C program to find largest element in an array	Code
Q6	Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an ARRAY
1.INSERT
2.DELETE
3.TRAVERSE
4.SEARCH	Code
Q7	Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the following operations:
1. Input new time
2. Display the time
3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the time by one second.If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour becomes 24, it is set to zero.	Code
Q8	Write a function that compares two arrays and returns 1 if they are identical and 0 otherwise.	Code
